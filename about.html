                                    <p>Hey! What's up; My name is Noah. I'm a 21 year old who likes to work on really odd stuff! I grew up playing games mostly and so in my personal opinion my general education and ability to learn can sometimes be a struggle for me, but I love to learn and always keep going.</p>
                                    <p>A big interest for me and most of my life growing up was Runescape - don't know why; just loved the idea of progressing. I still love games that hold great progression value (Breath of the Wild is a great example!) and so I still to this day play it. Currently I am not heavily committed to finishing my account due to my life being a pain in the ass and not much motivation, we've all been there.</p>
                                    <p>I currently smoke Mariuana, I have since I was 15 - it's something I felt always helped keep me sane. Not everyone agrees with the use of Marjiuana and I completely respect others opinons. I personally feel anyone should be able to do as they please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. We're all free to our own opinions on these subjects and I completely respect anyone who doesn't agree with my use of it - that is your opinion and you're allowed to have it. Totally alright with me brother.</p>
